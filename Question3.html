    <h1>I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I
query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</h1>

    <p>Hi [Customer Name],<br>
Thanks for reaching out.
If your Worker runs fine in the debugger but not when accessing your live site, here are a few things to check:</p>
     <p>Confirm that your Worker is correctly bound to a route in the Workers tab.<br>
Ensure Cloudflare is set up to proxy traffic (orange checkmark must be enabled in your DNS settings).<br> Workers only run when Cloudflare is proxying the request.<br>
Try purging the cache and make sure your route is active.</p>
     <p>If you're still experiencing issues after these steps, please send over your Worker script and the route configuration so I can review it for you.<br><br>
Thank you,<br>

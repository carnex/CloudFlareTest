    <p>Hi [Customer Name],<br>
What you're seeing is normal behavior based on how Cloudflare works. Cloudflare routes traffic based on optimal network topology, which doesn’t always align with physical location.<br> While this can seem counterintuitive, your traffic is being optimized for both reliability and performance.</p>
    <p> If you're curious about which data center you're connecting to, you can use the following tool to check: <a href="https://cloudflare-test.judge.sh/">cloudflare-test.judge.sh</a>
</p>
    <p>I hope this helps clarify your concerns. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out.<br><br>
Thank you,<br>
Cloudflare Support</p>

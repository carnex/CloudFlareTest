    <h1>How are Cloudflare's nameservers different from the DNS provided by Google DNS or OpenDNS? Can I delegate to
Cloudflare nameservers while still using my host’s DNS?</h1>

    <p>Hi [Customer Name],<br/>
Unfortunately, you cannot maintain your host's DNS while using Cloudflare, as Cloudflare becomes the authoritative DNS provider and is responsible for managing your domain's DNS settings.</p>
    <p>The difference between Cloudflare DNS and services like OpenDNS or Google DNS is that the latter are recursive resolvers — they are used by end users to look up domain names, not to host or manage them.<br/>
Think of it this way: Google DNS is like the global phone book, while Cloudflare is the service that publishes your phone number in that book.<br/>
If you have any additional questions or need further clarification, please don’t hesitate to reach out.<br/><br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Cloudflare Support</p>

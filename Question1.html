    <p>Hi [Customer Name],<br>
I checked the status of our Cloudflare nameservers and confirmed they are up and responding.<br>
Since you reported that <a href="http://example.com/">example.com</a> is unreachable from some networks, I investigated the issue and found the following:</p> 
    <p>Your DNS records are correctly configured and resolving as expected.<br>
Your nameservers are properly set up to point to Cloudflare.<br>
Global DNS checks returned the expected responses.</p> 
    <p>Given that the site is accessible from some networks but not others, this suggests a possible connectivity issue between those networks and the Cloudflare servers. I recommend reaching out to the administrators of the affected networks to investigate further.<br> 
If you have a machine available on one of the affected networks, I’d be happy to assist with a more detailed diagnostic using a traceroute.</p>
     <p>In the future, if you have concerns about Cloudflare’s availability, you can also check <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/">cloudflarestatus</a> for current status updates. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.</p>
